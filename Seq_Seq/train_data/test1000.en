the basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation .
in airway inflammation , various cells such as eosinophils , t-cells , mast cells , neutrophils , macrophages and airway epithelium , and various liquid factors are involved .
it is taken seriously that th2 cytokine is involved not only in central airway , but also in peripheral airway , in the position of airway inflammation .
for the treatment of asthma , it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs , mainly inhalation steroids , from the early stage , for the suppression of the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation .
in addition , objective evaluation of air flow restriction by a respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma .
it is evaluated by spirometry or peak flow meter , and airway hypersensitivity test is performed .
the evaluation of airway inflammation is performed by sputum test , measurement of nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration , expiration condensate measurement , and allergological examination .
the diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insufficiency of left heart and hyperventilation syndrome are the object of the differentiation .
as a result of our genetic analysis , the possibility that il-17f gene fulfills an important role in the disease state of asthma is guessed .
ccl5 is a chemokine induced strongly from airway epithelium in viral infection , and especially , it may fulfil an important role for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma .
when the attention was paid to the role of macrophage inhibitory factor , it was guessed that natural immune system is deeply involved in the disease state of allergy .
from the above , the understanding of the disease was deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological common pathway at the molecular level .
by making these pathways to be a target , it is expected to contribute to the advance in the prevention and treatment of asthma .
